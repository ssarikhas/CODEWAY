**Key Features:**
Task Management:

Create new tasks to be added to the to-do list.
Update tasks with additional details or modifications.
Track the progress of tasks efficiently.

User Interface Options:

Command-line interface for simplicity and ease of use.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a more visually appealing experience.

Implementation:

The project will be implemented in Python to leverage its versatility and ease of development.
Depending on user preference, the application will offer a command-line interface or a GUI, enhancing accessibility.
User Interaction:

Command-Line Interface:

Users interact with the application through text-based commands.
Commands may include adding tasks, updating task details, and viewing the to-do list.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Users navigate the application through a visually intuitive interface.
Features such as buttons, input fields, and task displays contribute to a seamless user experience.
Task Persistence:

The application will incorporate file handling techniques to ensure the persistence of to-do lists between sessions. This guarantees that users can access and modify their lists even after closing or restarting the application.
Error Handling:

To enhance user experience, the application will implement robust error handling. This includes providing informative error messages and preventing crashes during unexpected scenarios.

**Conclusion:**
The To-Do List Application project strives to offer users a flexible and efficient solution for task management. Whether through a command-line or GUI interface, users can easily create, update, and track their to-do lists, contributing to enhanced organization and productivity in their daily lives.

**Project 02: Basic GUI Calculator**
**Project Description:**
The "Basic GUI Calculator" is a Python-based application designed to provide users with an intuitive graphical interface for fundamental arithmetic calculations. Developed using the Tkinter library, this calculator offers simplicity and user-friendliness with dedicated buttons for numbers, arithmetic operators, and a display field. The project's primary goal is to deliver a straightforward and accessible calculator interface, enabling users to effortlessly perform everyday mathematical operations.

**Features:**

Graphical User Interface:

Utilizes Tkinter for an aesthetically pleasing graphical interface.
Includes buttons for numbers and arithmetic operators, enhancing user-friendliness.
Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Supports elementary operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Users input numerical values through dedicated buttons and execute calculations with corresponding operator buttons.
Real-Time Calculation:

Displays input and ongoing calculations in real-time on the calculator's interface.
Provides users with visibility into the expression they are entering.
Error Handling:

Implements robust error handling to prevent invalid calculations.
Displays clear and meaningful error messages when users input incorrect expressions.
Technical Details:

Developed in Python, leveraging the Tkinter library for GUI implementation.
The calculator's display field is created using a Tkinter Entry widget, showcasing both user input and calculation results.
Number and operator buttons are generated with Tkinter Button widgets, each linked to functions handling user interactions.
Utilizes the eval() function for evaluating user input and executing arithmetic calculations.
User Interaction:
Upon launching the application, users interact with the calculator through the following features:

Click on number buttons (0-9) for numerical input.
Click on operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to specify the desired arithmetic operation.
Input and results are displayed in real-time on the calculator's interface.
Click on "=" to perform the calculation and view the result.
Click on "C" to clear the input field and initiate a new calculation.
Potential Enhancements:
To enrich the project, consider implementing additional features such as:

Support for advanced arithmetic operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
Integration of keyboard input for numerical values and operators.
Implementation of memory functionality for storing and recalling previous calculations.
Incorporation of a theme switcher to offer different visual styles for the calculator.

**Conclusion:**
The "Basic GUI Calculator" stands as a user-friendly Python application, delivering simplicity and efficiency for fundamental arithmetic calculations through an intuitive graphical interface. Features such as real-time input display and error handling enhance the overall user experience. With potential enhancements, the application has the potential to accommodate advanced calculations and cater to diverse user preferences, expanding its versatility.
